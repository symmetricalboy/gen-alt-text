- Support for all media types (images, videos, animations)

### alt-text-web/ (Web Application)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **Production Ready** 
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Deployment**: Live at https://alttext.symm.app (Railway)
- **Architecture**: PWA with Express server

#### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Progressive Web App**: Installable with offline support
- **FFmpeg Integration**: v0.11.0 for client-side compression
- **Advanced UI**: Drag-and-drop, real-time feedback, compression logs
- **COEP/COOP Headers**: Proper SharedArrayBuffer support for FFmpeg
- **Large File Support**: Up to 100MB with compression options
- **Video Processing**: Multiple codec support with quality settings
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design for all devices

#### ‚úÖ Technical Features:
- Custom Express server with required security headers
- Web Worker compression to prevent UI freezing
- Automatic video compression for files >19MB
- Progressive compression with quality indicators
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Privacy policy and offline pages

#### üèóÔ∏è Needed Improvements:
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Integration**: Upgrade from current model
- **Enhanced File Limits**: 2GB limit with better UX
- **Review Workflow**: Force user review before final output
- **Chat Interface**: Correction requests and error reporting
- **UI Enhancements**: Version footer links, clickable branding

## üîß Technical Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Working Integrations:
1. **Client ‚Üî Server Communication**: Both extension and web app successfully communicate with backend
2. **AI Processing Pipeline**: Gemini API integration working with specialized instructions
3. **Video Compression**: Multiple FFmpeg implementations working across platforms
4. **File Handling**: Large file processing with automatic optimization
5. **Cross-platform Deployment**: Railway hosting working for both server and web app

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Architecture Concerns:
1. **Version Fragmentation**: Store versions significantly behind development
2. **Model Upgrade Needed**: Gemini 2.5 Flash not yet implemented in web app
3. **Extension Publishing Delays**: Store approval processes creating user experience gaps

## üìà Quality Assessment

### High Quality Components:
- **Backend Server**: Exceptionally robust with comprehensive AI instructions
- **Video Processing**: Advanced compression with multiple fallback strategies
